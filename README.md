# ContosoUniversity on ASP.NET Core with .NET Core

Contoso University, the way I would write it.

To run, create a database "ContosoUniversity" and run the "ContosoUniversity\App_Data\runAfterCreateDatabase\0001_InitialSchema.sql" script against it. Modify the connection string in appsettings and go!

## Things demonstrated

- CQRS and MediatR
- AutoMapper
- Feature folders and vertical slices
- HtmlTags
- Entity Framework Core

## How to run

First run the build script (Build.ps1). This will set up the local database using RoundhousE. Open the solution and run!
